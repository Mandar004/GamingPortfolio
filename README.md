Mandar Kaware
Unity Game Developer

With over 3 years of experience in game development, I currently serve as an Associate Unity Developer at Inawwgment India Pvt Ltd, a role I have held since February 2022. This position has allowed me to gain a deep understanding of game development processes and best practices. My work spans 3D, 2D, and AR & VR projects, where I have honed my technical expertise and problem-solving skills. I am well-versed in tools such as Unity3D, Adobe XD, Visual Studio, and Blender, which I use to create immersive and engaging experiences.

My career began at MT Software Solution in June 2021, where I laid a strong theoretical foundation that has been vital to my practical work. During this time, I collaborated closely with junior game developers, enhancing my abilities in teamwork, communication, and attention to detail.

I am eager to contribute to your company and continue growing my skills in a dynamic and supportive environment.
