Mandar Kaware         
Unity Game Developer

Currently working as an Associate Unity Developer at Inawwgment India Pvt Ltd since February 2022, I have been fortunate to develop a deep understanding of game development processes and best practices. I've been extensively involved in 3D,2D as well as AR & VR Projects which have allowed me to hone my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. My experience at Inawwgment India has helped me become well-versed in Unity3d, XD, Visual Studio and Blender.

My journey in the field of game development began at MT Software Solution in June 2021, where I gained theoretical knowledge that laid the foundation for my practical skills. I consistently contributed to projects involving Junior Game developers which required strong teamwork, effective communication, and attention to detail.

Thank you for reading my application. I am excited about the opportunity to potentially contribute to your company and further develop my skills in an environment that encourages growth.
